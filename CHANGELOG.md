## 1.3.0: Changed All The Things

**Released at**: `23.12.2020`

**Info**:

The primary goal of this update was to simplify maintenance of the list by cleaning up some really unfortunate cruft in the merges and consistency patches.  For now the ECTV section is gone but it will be returning in a much improved format in the future.  In the process of making these changes many mods were also updated, removed and swapped out... The end result is that gameplay should basically be the same even though all the things around it are different.  Fun times...

Future updates will focus on fixing some long standing bugs and balance concerns with hopefully less mod churn.

This update ***is NOT savefile safe***

**Notes**:

- Ensure that you copy the game folder files again for this update.
- If you had custom Display Tweaks settings don't forget to re-apply them.

Many bugs were fixed for 1.1.5 but ended up not being included since
the installer was broken before these changes could be wrapped up.
They will be included in 1.1.6.

Fixing broken installer due to mod updates.  Includes a rather large
change to Blade & Blunt.  You should go read the mod page.

## 1.1.4: Loot Overhaul #1

**Released at**: `16.05.2020`

**Info**:
Forced update due to mod changes. Loot has been overhauled bringing it closer
to the MLU style model of rarity.  Monsters still need to have their loot updated
to make them fall in line... I didn't have time to do that before the installer
stopped working.

Midgame update should be safe but you might experience some missing items and 
such due to the loot list changes.

## 1.1.3: Various Fixes

**Released at**: `14.05.2020`

**Info**:

Forced update due to mod dependencies. Elder Souls - Death has been updated to
grant gold on kill based on enemy level. In order for these changes to apply
to your already existing characters you need to delete `ElderSouls_DeathScript`
from your save using `Fallrim Tools`

There is no reason to update if you're happy with the current gold granting
system in ESD. Wait for a new character.

## 1.1.1: Fix the Gravemarker

**Released at**: `11.05.2020`

**Info**:

v1.1.0 suffered from a CTD caused by the new highly visible gravemarker. I have
reverted to the original gravemarker and re-opened [Gravemaker map marker](https://github.com/jdsmith2816/eldersouls/issues/7)

## 1.1.0: Gold on Corpses

**Released at**: `10.05.2020`

**Info**:

The primary focus of this release is fixes and quality of life updates for the
`Elder Souls - Death` mod. This release makes grave markers highly visible and
ensures that all enemies now have an amount of liquid currency on their corpse.
Additionally you can now disable `Elder Souls - Death` prior to creating your
character if you wish to play without the custom character progression and death
system.

**This update is most likely _NOT_ save-file safe. If you wish to continue playing
with your current save then _DO NOT_ update to v1.1.0** No support will be given
for those that choose to ignore this warning!

## 1.0.2: No Moar BSAs

**Released at**: `01.05.2020`

**Info**:

Various people had serious issues with the compressed BSA files that shipped with the initial release of Elder Souls. The primary goal of this release is to revert back to a 'normal' installation to hopefully resolve the problems for those people. Unfortunately this will result in slower load times and significantly more hard drive space utilized by the game.

To ensure that your save file remains useable please perform the following procedure BEFORE you update:

1. Open the DynDOLOD MCM and deactivate the mod
2. Wait for the deactivation message
3. Go into an interior cell
4. Go back into the MCM and ensure that DynDOLOD shows as deactivated
5. Save the game
6. Update Elder Souls
7. Load your game and head outside.
8. DynDOLOD should now initialize itself; if it doesn't then activate it via MCM
9. That's it.

See below for the various other updates and changes included in this update.
